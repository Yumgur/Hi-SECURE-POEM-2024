- **Type:** R Markdown file.
- **Functionality:** Generates various chart types using `ggplot2` and creates interactive reports.
- **Usage:**
  - Open the file in RStudio.
  - Click the "Knit" button to generate an HTML report.
- **Average Run Time:** **Approximately 1 minute**.

### 2. **`Hi-secure_plot.ipynb`**
- **Type:** Jupyter Notebook file.
- **Functionality:** Creates advanced visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook Hi-secure_plot.ipynb
  ```
  - Run the notebook in your browser.
- **Average Run Time:** **Approximately 2 minutes**.

## Steps to Run

1. Ensure that the necessary software and dependencies are installed.
2. Place the dataset in the specified `data/` folder.
3. Depending on the script type, use either the R or Python environment to execute the code.
4. Review the output files or generated interactive charts.
